# Sorting-Algorithms
This repository implements well known sorting algorithms. It's the occasion to practise some basic algorithmic notions and language specificities. This is just for training purposes.


## Algorithms implemented
The project should implement the following sorting alogrithms :

  - Bubble sort
  - Insertion sort
  - Selection sort
  - Merge sort
  - (Heap sort)
  - Shell sort
  - Quick sort
  - (Quick3 sort)

## Languages used
Some interesting languages to use would be the following :
  - **Python** : current language
  - *Java*
  - C
  - *C++*
  - C#

## Links used :
I went through a bit of documentation to implement these algorithms. See the *Documentation/Algorithms* for details

  - With schemas and explanations : [Tutorials point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/bubble_sort_algorithm.htm)
  - With animations for each sort according to sample types [Top tals](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms)
